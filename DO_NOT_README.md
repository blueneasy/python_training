# Python Training
## __
My very own repository for notes and exercises taken during this Python bootcamp: 
\
https://www.pythonacademy.pl

Please do not read the code as it does not make any sense without the proper context.
During this learning period, I'm also doing the 100 days of code bootcamp:
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/ 

I put a clean code for every project in a separate folder in 100days repository.
